# **Prework Study Guide**

## **Description**
---
My motivation for this project was lots of coffee and knowing that if I drink enough of it, it will finish itself... it worked!  But sometimes I do enjoy coding and breaking things.  I built this project NOT because it was a homework assignment, but because I need to make notes on what I will be learning in this course; and there's no better place to make notes than a website.  The notes included are now in one place; easy to find and readable.  I came into this course with some knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but I learned a lot about Git/GitHub, work flow in a professional setting, version control, etc.  My old way of coding was to just use Notepad and save everything locally in folders.  I actually really enjoyed watching the GitHub Workflow to see how it's done in a professional environment, as I would love to finish this course with a job!

## **Installation**
---
N/A.

## **Usage**
---
The Prework Study Guide is a reference of notes accumulated throughout studying the precourse material.  It is divided into 4 sections: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.  Using a console, JavaScript in action can be seen, with each refresh of the page showing a randomised outcome; demonstrating if statements, for loops, use of variables, arrays and the Math object.
